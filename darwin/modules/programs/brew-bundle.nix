        This option manages what happens to formulas installed by Homebrew, that aren't present in
        the Brewfile generated by this module.

        When set to <literal>"none"</literal> (the default), formulas not present in the generated
        Brewfile are left installed.

        When set to <literal>"uninstall"</literal>, <command>nix-darwin</command> invokes
        <command>brew bundle install</command> with the <command>--cleanup</command> flag. This
        uninstalls all formulas not listed in generate Brewfile, i.e.,
        <command>brew uninstall</command> is run for those formulas.

        When set to <literal>"zap"</literal>, <command>nix-darwin</command> invokes
        <command>brew bundle install</command> with the <command>--cleanup --zap</command>
        flags. This uninstalls all forumalas not listed in the generated Brewfile, and if the
        formula is a cask, removes all files associated with the cask. In other words,
        <command>brew uninstall --zap</command> is run for all those formulas.

        If you plan on exclusively using <command>nix-darwin</command> to manage formulas installed
        by Homebrew, you probably want to set this option to <literal>"uninstall"</literal> or
        <literal>"zap"</literal>.
